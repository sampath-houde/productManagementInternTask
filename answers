1) What new features will you build? What are your assumptions? 
The features we can build to solve this problem are as follows :-
To make a separate section for healthy foods like salads, soups, etc, so that we can separate healthy foods from junk foods.
We can make a section to deliver raw materials to the user, so that the user can make the dish instantly at his home. 
We can give an option of rating the quality of food, when it gets delivered. 
We can add a filter section in the app, where user can filter restaurants based on their ratings and reviews on quality of food.
We can target the users who are health conscious, by mentioning the nutrients they will be getting from the food they are ordering.

2)How might you market this feature? 
There will be two types of user, to whom we will be marketing this feature -
Existing Users 
New Users
-> First we will highlight this new feature in our app and on our website.
-> For existing users, we can push notifications and send emails highlighting our new feature. 
-> We can give beta access to the users who want to use, and based on their response we can improve our feature and plan our marketing strategies.
-> To introduce our feature to the world, we can collaborate with content creators and market our feature through them.
-> We can create short videos and long explanatory videos and promote it on all of our Social Networks.


3)Which users will be targeted first for this feature? 
The users who have the application already installed on their phone, we can release this feature to 5-10% of the people. We will take feedbacks from them, and improve this feature as much as possible and until, we get positive feedbacks from the users. After completely and thoroughly testing the feature, we will rollout this feature to everyone.


4)How will you measure if your feature is successful? 
We can measure the success of the feature by - 
-> total number of times a user the feature.
-> the percentage of total active users who are using the feature.
-> the average times per day users are using the feature.
-> the day at which the user use the feature
-> the category of food which is being ordered the most by the active users.
